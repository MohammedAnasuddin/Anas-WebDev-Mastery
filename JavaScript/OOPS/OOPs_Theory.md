### Classes
- JS didn't have classes support by default, they were introduced in ES6.
- P.S: The classes were added so that C# devs can feel comfortable to migrate to JS
- Class is factory of Objects and describes the:
    - Data Structure
    -  External Links
- Class is a definition of Object
- Types Include:
    - Data Classes: Stores only Data
    - Behavioral Classes: Stores both data and functions
- Classes can be treated as Custom Data Structures.

### Challenges of Procedural Programming
- Programming using functions
    1. Can't Protect data at global scope -> security
    2. Not easily shareable -> reusability 
    3. Dependency overloaded -> changes are though
    
### OOPs
- Motto: Any error shouldn't effect the performance of overall performance.
### Drawback of OOPs
- gets unnecessary properties when retrieved
- Eg: Child gets the properties of Parent , when the service just need a property of child

### Objects
