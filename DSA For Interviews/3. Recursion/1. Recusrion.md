# Recursion

The process of Function **caling itself** to *solve smaller versions* of the same problem,


**Components of Recursion**

1. **Base Case**: Condition for Function to **stop** calling itself

2.  **Recursive Case**: Condition for Function to call itself
    

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. Not having a base Case : Always ahave a base caseto stop function calling itself or else it resukts in stack overflow

2. Constant Input: Inpu should be simplified (reduced) for next function calls else base condition is never reached.

3. Deep Recursion : Optimize recursion for Large Inputs

4. Consider teh Complexity: Recursion has `O(n)` for **n** inputs.
