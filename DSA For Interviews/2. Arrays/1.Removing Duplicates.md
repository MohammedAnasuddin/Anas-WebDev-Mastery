# 26. Removing Duplicates

## Understading Probem Statement

> Given an integer array `nums` sorted in **non-decreasing order**, remove the duplicates [**in-place**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm) such that each unique element appears only **once**. The **relative order** of the elements should be kept the **same**.
> 
> The first `k` elements of `nums` should contain the unique numbers in **sorted order**. The remaining elements beyond index `k - 1` can be ignored.

**Integer**: Array can have both negative and Postive numbers/digits

**Non-Decreasing Order** : Same elements are together but elemets of Next group are greater than current group . the sorting condition is : `arr[i+1]<=arr[i]` 

**in-place**: The elements should appear in same order as in input.

**relative-order**: We should modify the given array itself can't use a new array.

## Solution

```js
var removeDuplicates = function(nums) {
    let k =0;
    for(let i=0;i<nums.length;i++){
        if(nums[i]>nums[k]){
            k++;
            nums[k] = nums[i]
        }
    }

    return k+1;
};
```

**Why didn't we use HashSet?**
Since the array is already  Non-decreaseing grouped if we use `.add` it would be executed on every element which is a heavy operation when compared to the comparison operation.
