# 27. Removing Element

## Understading Probem Statement

> Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `val`, remove all occurrences of `val` in `nums` [**in-place**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm). The order of the elements may be changed. Then return *the number of elements in* `nums` *which are not equal to* `val`.
> 
> Consider the number of elements in `nums` which are not equal to `val` be `k`, to get accepted, you need to do the following things:
> 
> - Change the array `nums` such that the first `k` elements of `nums` contain the elements which are not equal to `val`. The remaining elements of `nums` are not important as well as the size of `nums`.
> - Return `k`.

**Integer**: Array can have both negative and Postive numbers/digits

**in-place**: The elements should appear in same order as in input.



## Solution

```js
var removeElement = function(nums, val) {
    let i=0,k=0
    for(i=0;i<nums.length;i++){
        if(nums[i] != val){
            nums[k]=nums[i]
            k++;
        }
}

return k;
};
```

**Why did we just returned `k` why not `k+1`?**

Since the `k` has already moved to the next element which is not part of `k`, so we need to return one less than the current value of `k` thanks to zero indexing of array it's already done.
