# 121. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock

> You are given an array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the `ith` day.
> 
> You want to maximize your profit by choosing a **single day** to buy one stock and choosing a **different day in the future** to sell that stock.
> 
> Return *the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction*. If you cannot achieve any profit, return `0`.




## Approach

Find the minimum buy rate and use it calculate the profits and constantly check for minimum value.


```js
var maxProfit = function(prices) {
    let min = prices[0];
    let max = 0;

    for(let i =0;i<prices.length;i++){
        if(prices[i]-min>max){
            max=prices[i]-min;
        }
        if(prices[i]<min){
            min = prices[i]
        }
    }

    return max;
};
```
