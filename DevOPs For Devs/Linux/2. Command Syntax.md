# Command Syntax

Command is A program or instruction (text-based) you give to the shell so it can perform an action.

# **General Syntax of a Linux Command**

Every command on Linux follows a predictable pattern:

```
command [options] [arguments]
```

> `NOTE`
> 
> **Order generally doesn’t matter**
> 
> Linux doesn’t care much if you place flags before or after arguments.



### **1. `command`**

The actual program you want to run.  
Examples: `ls`, `cd`, `mkdir`, `git`, `docker`, `systemctl`

---

### **2. `[options]` (aka flags or switches)**

These modify *how* the command works. 
Options usually start with:

- `-` for short options (single letter) 
  Example: `-l`, `-a`, `-f`

- `--` for long options  
  Example: `--all`, `--force`, `--help`

Example:

```
ls -l
ls --all
```

### **Important Patterns to Remember**

**Short options can be combined**

```
ls -l -a
ls -la
```

**Long options cannot be combined**

```
ls --all --color
```

---

### **3. `[arguments]`**

These tell the command **what** you want it to act on.

Examples:

```
mkdir project-folder
rm file.txt
cat notes.md
```

---

# **Full Example**

```
ls -la /home/anas
```

Breakdown:

- `ls` → command

- `-la` → options (`-l` = long format, `-a` = show hidden files)

- `/home/anas` → argument (path to list)
