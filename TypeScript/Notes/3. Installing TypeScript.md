# Installating TypeScript

`TS` can be installed in two ways:

1. Globally using `-g` flag

2. For Projects

> It's recommended to install for projects

## Installing for Projects

1. run `npm run init -y`

2. Install `npm -D typescript`

      > **TypeScript is only used during development**
      > 
      > TypeScript’s job is:
      > 
      > - type checking
      > 
      > - catching mistakes
      > 
      > - giving IntelliSense
      > 
      > - compiling `.ts` → `.js`
      > 
      > All of this happens **before** your code ever runs on the server.
      > 
      > Your production server **never executes TypeScript**. 
      > It only executes **plain JavaScript** (the output of the compiler).
      > 
      > So the compiler itself (`tsc`) is only needed during development.
      
      

3. create the `TS`config `npx tsc --init`

4. config the `src` and `dist` paths in `tsconfig`
