# Indexes

As Database scale using query methods becomes expensive since needs to traverse all the documents

To solve this we use indexes

## Creating Compound Indexes

When we need to optimize the querying which includes multiple fields

Create an index(in Schema File) with all the required fields . mongoDB will optimize it;s traversing

```js
SchemaName.index({
    fieldOne:1, // 1 Ascending , -1 Descending
    fieldTwo:1,
})
```

> Index essentials fields which needs to be indexed
