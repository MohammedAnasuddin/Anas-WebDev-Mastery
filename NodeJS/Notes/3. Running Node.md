# Running NodeJS Code

Use Node REPL mode

> REPL stands for Read, Evaluate , Print the Output , Loop

To go into this mode run `node` in terminal and any JS code can be executed here.

```bash
Welcome to Node.js v22.18.0.
Type ".help" for more information.
```

The JS code is executed in the Node Runtime Environment

> REPL is not ideal choice to write production code.

## Creating Our First File

Create a file_name.js
To run the code in the JS file : Run `node file_name` in terminal

> JS code gets executed line by line since synchronous single threaded execution

## Global Object

The window object of browser in NodeJS Environment
It is not the part of v8 Engine but one of the superpowers form NodeJS

Gives access to setTimeout, setInterval

> `Note` 
> 
> `this` does not return the global object on calling from global scope in NodeJS Environment
> 
> There were many ways to access the window object (this, self, window) this created conflict Hence , ES2020 standardize it to `globalThis`
> 
>  In NodeJS, `globalThis==global` returns true
