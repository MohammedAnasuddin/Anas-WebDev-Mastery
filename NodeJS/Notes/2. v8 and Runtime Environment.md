# JS ON SERVER

## Server

A machine which serves(fulfills) the requests made to it.

Initially  JS was can only be run on web browser but NodeJS enables us to run on `JS` on this machine as well.

> Chrome V8 engine is written in C++ , Thus JS engine is nothing but a  C++ application. V8 can be embedded into any C++ application.

> NodeJS is a C++ application having Chrome V8 engine inside it.

## If JS can be run using V8 why NodeJS?

V8 cannot go beyond executing ECMAScript, but NodeJS gives the v8 to go beyond ECMAScript i.,e features other than just executing JS.

Example: APIs , Database Connection 

## Engine VS Run Time Environment

### JavaScript Engine

The JavaScript engine is a program that directly executes JavaScript code.Â Its primary responsibility is to *translate the human-readable JavaScript code into machine-executable instructions.* 

Examples of JavaScript engines include Google's V8 (used in Chrome and Node.js), Apple's JavaScript Core (used in Safari and Bun), and Mozilla's SpiderMonkey (used in Firefox).

> **Why call it a Engine rather than Compiler when it just translates?**
> A compiler is only one part of the JS engine's entire operation
> 
> JS Engine is not a single compiler but a collection of compilers that work on code at different stages getting the code to the browser.

### JavaScript Run Time

The JavaScript runtime environment is a broader concept that encompasses the JavaScript engine along with additional components and APIs necessary for *JavaScript code to interact with its surrounding environment*.

While the engine handles the core execution of the language, the runtime provides the context and tools for input/output operations, asynchronous programming, and interaction with external resources.

For instance, in a web browser, the JavaScript runtime includes the JavaScript engine, but also provides Web APIs (like the DOM, XMLHttpRequest, timers)

### The Difference

JavaScript engine is the core component responsible for **executing the language** itself, while the JavaScript runtime environment provides the comprehensive set of tools and functionalities that **enable JavaScript code to operate within a specific context**, whether that be a web browser, a server, or another embedded environment.
