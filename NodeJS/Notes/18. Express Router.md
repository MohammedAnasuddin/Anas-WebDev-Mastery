# Express Router

Router helps to group APIs

> `TIP`
> 
> Name/group the routes by the base segment of the path for better classification. 
> 
> For example `auth/signup` , `auth/login` name the router as `auth` (group them)



## Creating the Routers

1. Create a folder `src/routes`

2. Create a file for dedicated router (`auth.js`)

3. Create a Router by using `express.router` 
   
   1. `const authRouter = express.router()`

4. To create Routes use the above router instead of `app`

5. Export the Router
   
   ```js
   const routerName = express.Router()
   routerName.post("/path", middleware, Route_Handler)
   module.exports=routerName
   ```



## Linking Routers to the Server

1. Require  the router in Server Entry.

2. using `app`, Create Dedicated `/` route for each Router 

3. Now , whenever a API call is made, Each router is checked for the path in the request if matched executes it's Router Handler. 

```js
const routerName= require("./routes/routerName")
app.use("/", routerName)
```
