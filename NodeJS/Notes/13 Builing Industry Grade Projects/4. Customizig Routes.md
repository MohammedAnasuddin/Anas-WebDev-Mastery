# HTTP Method in Express

By default every route on browser is `GET` that's the reason if route not found the error is `Cannot GET route`  

> `NOTE`
> 
> Browser is the worst way to test API use Postman Instead.

## Handling Multiple Methods using Express

`.use()` will match the rout for every HTP Methods.

To explicitly match a route for a required method call use `.<method_name>`  

> `NOTE`
> 
> Make sure of right order , placing `.use()` above them will overwrite every method call with same route.

## Routing Expressions

1. `?` Optional : Matching will be the same if the segment is present or not.
   
   1. `/ab?c`  Matches both  `/abc` and `/ac`

2. `+` Additonal : Match the routes even if `n` multiple consecutive segments
   
   1. `/ab+c` Matches `/abc`, `/abbbc`, `/abbb...bc` 

3. `*` Anything : matches anything in place of the segment
   
   1. `/ab*c` Matches `/abxyzc`, `/ab1234c`

4. `()` grouping : Can group segments for above operators
   
   1. `/a(bc)+z` matches `/abcbcbcbc...bcz`

5. `/regExp/` Regular Expressions: matches for the pattersn matching `regExp`



## Getting the query_parameters from the route

use `req.query` to get all the query_parameters from the route_url  



## Dynamic Routes

use `"/:param"` to the route this match path, to get this params use `req.params`
