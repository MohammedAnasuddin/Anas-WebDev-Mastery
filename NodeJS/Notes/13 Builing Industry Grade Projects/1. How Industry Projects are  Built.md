## Monolith vs Microservices

Monolith is everything in a single repo.

Microservices dedicated repos(project) for respective services.

| **Monolith**                                                 | **Microservices**                                |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Slower Development sinceÂ  need to compiling all the services | Faster Development                               |
| Though Scalability                                           | Can Scale services Independently                 |
| Single deployment for a project                              | All the services needs to be deployed separately |
| Restricted to a single Tech Stack                            | Each Service can have its own Tech Stack         |
| Less Cost                                                    | More cost since more no. of components           |
| Easy at beginning though later                               | Easy                                             |
| Faults affects the whole project                             | Faults affects only the source service.          |
| Integration testing is easier                                | Testing Integration is tougher                   |
| Central Ownership                                            | Dedicated team for each service                  |
| Though Updates and Maintenance                               | Easy to apply changes and Maintain               |
| Easier Debugging                                             | Blame game                                       |
