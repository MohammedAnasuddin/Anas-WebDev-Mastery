# Databases

Database is an **ORGANIZED/STRUCTED** Collection of data.

Database Management is a software that interacts with application and database.

## Types of Databases

1. Relational Databases: MySQL, PostgreSQL

2. No=SQL : MongoDB

### Relational Databases RDBMS

Databases which satisfied the **Codd's 12 Rules**

#### MySQL

Created by Michael Widensis and currently managed by Oracle 

> He dedicated the database to eldest daughter name **My** hence the name `MySQL`

#### PostgreSQL

On Resume , he named the project **Post Ingres** 

> **SQL** 
> 
> Structured Query Language. The Language to interact with DBMS vis Queries. It is read as *Sequel*

### No-SQL Databases

Not only SQL Databases

##### Types of No-SQL Databases

1. Document DB

2. Key Value DB

3. Graph DB

4. Wide column DB

5. Multi Model DB

#### MongoDB

Started in 2009 and developed by `10GEN` Now MongoDB Inc

> **The name mongo**
> 
> It is derived form the word  "**Hu*mongo*us**"

Very Flexible, Compatible with NodeJS and Boost DX

Stores data as `Collections` and stores data in `Document`

using these there is no need of `JOINS` and `Normalization`

### RDMS v/s NO SQL

| **RDMS**                    | **NOSQL**                                   |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Tables, Columns and Rows    | Collections, Documents and Field            |
| Structured Data             | Unstructured Data                           |
| Fixed Schema (Strict Rules) | Flexible Schema (easy going)                |
| SQL                         | Depends on the DB <br/> MongoDB - > MQL     |
| Though Horizontal Scaling   | Easy Horizontal and Vertical Scaling        |
| Relationships via Keys      | Nested Data                                 |
| Read Heavy Apps             | Real time , Big Data, Distributed Computing |
| Used in Banking             | Used in Real Time                           |
