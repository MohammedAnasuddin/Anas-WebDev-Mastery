# Working of V8 Engine

- `Stage-1`: PARSING
  
  - `Lexical Analysis (Tokenization)`: Code is broken down into Tokens
  
  - `Syntax Analysis`: Tokens are converted to Abstract Syntax Tree
    
    - > If code is unable to generate AST, then it will throw `Syntax Error`
  
  - `Interpretter`: 
    
    - > `Interpreter` v/s `Compilier` 
      > 
      > > In English, Interpreter means to *immediately* translate what somebody is saying
      > > 
      > > Compilation refers to *collection* and organizing information into an list.
      > 
      > By the above definitions we say Interpreter immediately executes lines it encounters and Compiler collects all the lines and then executes them together at last.
    
    - JS is neither Interpreter nor Compiler it's  a combination of both known as `JIT (Just in Time)` Compilation.
    
    - V8's Interpreter `Ignition Interpreter` Converts the AST to Byte Code. 
    
    - `OPTIMIZATION`:   `Ignition Intrepreter` identifies  piece of code which is most used (repeated multiple time) (this code is known as `HOT Code`)  and provide it to the V8's Compiler `Turbofan Compilier` this compiles the `HOT code` and creates a Optimized Machine Code.  
    
    - > This solves the slow execution of `Intrepreter` by eliminating need to processing repeating lines since they are already processed by `Turbofan Compilier` 
    
    - If a change occurs in the `HOT Code` then code gets de-optimizes and `Ignition Intrepretor` process it line by line normally.
    
    - `Garbage Collection` is performed parallelly to the `JIT Compilation` .V8's Garbage Collectors are Orinoco, OilPan ,Scavenger.
