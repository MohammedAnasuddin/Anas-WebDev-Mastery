## Handling Frontend and Backend Communication

### Solving CORS

### Proxy

> Proxy only works in development mode it fails in production

In vite config add teh server configuration

```js
server : {
    proxy: {
    "route": {
    target : "URL for Server",
    changeOrigin: true,
    }
   }
}
```

It wraps the frontend port to mentioned port on server configuration 

Server assumes the reques is from same port thus allows it.

> `NOTE`
> 
> While using `proxy` you can mention the base URL and port while calling the api.





### CORS-Best Way

REsolves the restriction of communication at backend of the project.


```js
app.use(cors(
    {
    origin: [
            "baseURL/port",
            "baseURL/port-1",
            "serveURL",
            "productionURL"
        ]

    }
))
```



> `TIP`
> 
> In DEvlopment MOde , Always add a -1 port number as well (if frontend port is 5174 also add 5173) browsers fallback to one lesser port if current one is failed.






## Dockerizing Backend

Create a new file `Dockerfile` with no extension
