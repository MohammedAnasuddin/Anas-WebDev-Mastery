# Databases

All the values(variables) generated during execution are allotted in the Memory. Which is temporary.

To store values , data permanently on Hard drive/Server so that data can be reused we use Databases.

> No Database is wrong or more effective. Select your database based on your project requirements and the final goal.

## Types of Databases

1. SQL

2. No-SQL (Not **ONLY** SQL) -> More than SQL

3. Others

> `NOTE`
> 
> Never ever perform operations on Database from the Frontend .
> Use Server to process the request and then operate on Database.



## ORM

Object Relation Mapper

Layer that Connects the Server to DB for easy processing. Eg: mongoose and Prisma.
